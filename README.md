# News App
This is my app for the **(v1) News App** project. It's part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.

## What is it about?
This app fetches news data from The Guardian API.
* It uses the "test" API key.
* In the menu of the Navigation Drawer at the left, the user can select the section: either World, Australia, Technology, Science or Sport.
* In the right upper corner, there is a menu allowing the user to refresh the list of news or enter the maximum number of results to be fetched.

## IDE
* Android Studio 3.0.1

## Tested with
* Hardware devices: Samsung SM-G935F (Android 7.0, API 24), LGE Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1, API 23).
