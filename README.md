# Book Search
This is my **Book Listing App**. It's a project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).

## What is it about?
* Upon keywords entered by the user, this app searches for book data by making use of Google Books API.
* The search results are listed in a ListView.
* A click on a list item will open a webpage that provides more details on the book.
* In the Settings menu, the user can change the maximum number of search results. It's 10 by default and maximum 40.

## IDE
* Android Studio 3.0.1

## Tested with
* Hardware devices: Samsung SM-G935F (Android 7.0, API 24), LGE Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1, API 23)
